# Welcome to AR/VR/Generative AI

The goal is to create an AR world using Meta Quest 3, integrating generative AI and computer vision for enhanced interaction. The project begins with learning Unity to understand 2D/3D object manipulation. Following this, an interactive environment is created and demonstrated in Unity, showcasing a mesh environment with simulated interactions. This environment is then integrated with Meta Quest 3, allowing it to be displayed and interacted with using the headset.

The next phase involves implementing LucidVR gloves to mimic object handling. Starting with simple shapes using the GitHub code, the project progresses to more detailed models. Generative AI is then added to provide real-time assistance. Finally, computer vision is applied to enhance interaction by tracking hands and fingers using Meta Quest 3 sensors, providing visual feedback for a more immersive experience.

The end goal is a functional AR/VR system that offers real-time, AI-assisted help with computer vision enhancements, creating a comprehensive and cost-effective AR/VR experience. For example, this system can assist users in real-world tasks like car repairs by providing interactive and AI-driven guidance.
